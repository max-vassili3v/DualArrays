"""
    DualArrays

A Julia package for efficient automatic differentiation using dual numbers and dual arrays.

This package provides:
- `Dual`: A dual number type for storing values and their derivatives
- `DualVector`: A vector of dual numbers represented with a Jacobian matrix

Differentiation rules are mostly provided by ChainRules.jl.
