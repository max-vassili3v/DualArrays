# Illustration of computing times for jacobians
# using DualArrays and ForwardDiff.
#
# We observe that for vector-valued functions with a sparse jacobian,
# performance is significantly better using DualArrays.jl
# i.e if the n x n jacobian has O(n) nonzero entries, then
# DualArrays.jl computes it in O(n) time.
